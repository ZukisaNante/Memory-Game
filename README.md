## Application of the tools used
### HTML
> - HTML was used for the layout and structure of the page
> - In our HTML index page we have defined columns housing our cards.
> - Inside of each an every column we have a DIV with a class initializing a card.
> - The cards were all assigned a back and front background-color, thus, an IMG SRC was used to hold images.
> - The advantages of not using CSS for the images was to avoid different naming of the cards and styling 
    them separately. Therefore, our CSS became shorter (less code) and neat.
